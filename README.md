# Understanding Persistent Storage on Akash: A Conceptual Guide

Imagine your application's data staying safe and sound, even if the application itself changes. That's the power of persistent storage. This guide explains the *concepts* of persistent storage on Akash Network and how it's configured, even without building a real application.

## Why is Persistent Storage Important?

Many applications rely on persistent storage to function correctly.  Here are some real-world examples:

*   **Databases:**  A blog needs a database to store its posts.  Without persistent storage, all those blog posts would vanish every time the blog application was updated or restarted!
*   **User Data:**  Think about a social media app.  It needs to store user profiles, photos, and posts.  Persistent storage ensures that your profile and pictures are still there when you log back in, even if the app's servers have been updated.
*   **Game Servers:**  Online games need to save player progress.  Persistent storage allows game servers to save player levels, scores, and items, so players can pick up where they left off.

Persistent storage is crucial for any application that needs to keep data safe and accessible over time.

## How Persistent Storage Works on Akash (Conceptually)

Akash Network uses *volumes* to provide persistent storage.  A volume is like a separate storage space that is connected to your application's container.
The volume is *independent* of the container. It exists even if the container is stopped, removed, or updated.  This is what makes the data persistent.

## The Service Definition Language (SDL)

The SDL file (`deployment.yaml`) is used to define *how* an application is deployed on Akash. It's like a set of instructions that tells Akash how to run your application, including how to set up persistent storage.  We'll focus on the `volumes` section of the SDL, as this is where we configure persistent storage.

## Configuring Persistent Storage in the SDL

Here's an example `deployment.yaml` file:

```yaml
version: "2.0"

services:
  web:
    image: your-dockerhub-username/your-web-app:latest # Placeholder image
    expose:
      - port: 8080
        as: 8080
        to:
          - global: true
    volumes:
      - data-volume:/app/data # Mount the volume "data-volume" to "/app/data"

profiles:
  compute:
    web:
      resources:
        cpu:
          units: 1.0
        memory:
          size: 512Mi
        storage:
          size: 512Mi

volumes:
  data-volume: # Define the volume
    size: 1Gi # Size of the volume
Explanation of the volumes Configuration:

services.web.volumes: This section mounts the persistent volume to a location inside the container (/app/data). Think of it like plugging a USB drive into your computer. Any files or data written to /app/data inside the container will actually be stored in the persistent volume.
volumes (top-level): This section defines the persistent volume itself. data-volume is the name of the volume. This name must match the name used in the services.web.volumes section. size: 1Gi specifies that the volume will be 1 Gigabyte in size. Akash will create a 1GB storage space for your application's data.
image:: This line specifies the application to run. We're using a placeholder image (your-dockerhub-username/your-web-app:latest) because we are not actually deploying an application in this documentation example. In a real deployment, you would replace this with the actual path to your Docker image on a container registry like Docker Hub.
Example Use Case: A Simple Blog
Let's imagine a simple blog application.  This blog needs to store its posts (text, images, etc.) so that they don't disappear when the blog application is updated or restarted.

With persistent storage, the actual blog posts would be stored in files inside the data-volume at the /app/data location.  When the blog application starts, it would connect to these files to retrieve and display the blog posts to users.

Data Persistence Explained
Because the data is stored in the volume, and the volume is separate from the container, the data remains safe even if the container is stopped, removed, or updated.  When a new container is started (even a different version of the application), it can access the same volume and the same data.  This is the core concept and the key benefit of persistent storage.

Conclusion
Persistent storage is essential for many applications deployed on Akash Network.  By correctly configuring the volumes section in the SDL file, you can ensure that your application's data is safe, persistent, and readily available.  This guide has provided a conceptual overview of how persistent storage works on Akash.  For real-world deployments, you would need to build and push a Docker image of your application and use the Akash Console or CLI to deploy it using the SDL file.
